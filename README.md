# Pawbs Ressource Pack

yo it's tat and there is my ressource pack for both java and bedrock (making ressource packs on bedrock is hard lol)

will have updates sometimes randomly

have fun with it ig, you can suggest ideas, or even try to help me making it if you want

you're free to do whatever you want with it :)

edit: im aware it is not updated and armor models dont work on newer version

the legend says tat will never finish a single project of their life
